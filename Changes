0.03    2014-05-28  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - [grammar] D1-D2 is a duration, not a date.

        - Use delta_days() to calculate D1-D2, not subtract_datetime(). The
          former results in exact number of days (e.g. P4W4D instead of P1M1D).

        - Support numeric operator +, -.

        - Support numeric functions abs(), round().
